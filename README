bdog-node provides haxe type signatures to Node.js. 

In this project only the files required to use the Node.js type signatures are provided.
Previously I bundled the entire the haxe js dir, but I feel this was probably a confusion
for anyone coming from outside the haxe communtity. Other haxe integration features will
be bundled in separate libs.

Status
------

The base Node API is in js/Node.hx. 

API is now (more or less) at 0.1.99

Note, I haven't wrapped Assert or REPL.
Partially added Script, didn't do static methods.
Partial Crypto.


Compiling with haxe
-------------------

NOTE: BEGIN_SRC is for emacs orgmode source highlighting

For example, file Ex1.hx

#+BEGIN_SRC haxe

import js.Node;

class Ex1 {
   public static function main() {
      trace(Node.process.memoryUsage());
      trace(Node.process.memoryUsage().heapTotal);

      var dns = Node.dns();
      dns.resolve("ipowerhouse.com","A",function(err,ips:Array<Dynamic>) {
          trace(ips);
          });
   }

}

#+END_SRC

Compile with

haxe -D nodejs -cp . -js ex1.js -main Ex1

where -cp . adds the current directory to the classpath which should include the provided js 
directory. You must add  -D nodejs to the compile line.

and then to execute

node ex1.js

Ex1.hx:6: {
	rss : 10039296, 
	vsize : 638578688, 
	heapTotal : 5005376, 
	heapUsed : 2497376
}
Ex1.hx:7: 5029952
Ex1.hx:11: [204.232.203.106]
